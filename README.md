## 🔹 Abstract

This repository outlines a secure, modular, and user-controlled memory architecture for ChatGPT and other LLM-based systems.

The core idea: enable memory to be stored **locally or in cloud-based storage** under the **exclusive control of the user**, including segmentation, encryption, backup, and deletion.

Inspired by:
- Crypto hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Secure enclaves (Apple T2, Yubikey)
- Privacy-first, zero-knowledge models
- BYOB (Bring Your Own Backup)

## ✅ Key Concepts

- External memory device with segment-based structure: **BIO / HISTORY / TASKS / MARKED**
- End-to-end encryption; **user-only key management**
- Emergency wipe (hardware/software)
- Optional hybrid cloud sync
- **No access** by OpenAI or external servers
- Timestamped publication for proof of authorship
