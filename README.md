# ChatGPT Memory Key ‚Äî External User-Controlled Memory Architecture (BIO-DISK Concept)

Author: Dr. Evgeny Feldman  
Date: May 2025

## üîπ Abstract
This repository outlines a secure, modular, and user-controlled memory solution for ChatGPT and other LLM-based systems.

The core idea: allow memory to be stored locally (USB drive, cloud partition) under the full control of the user, including segmentation, encryption, backup, and deletion.

Inspired by:
- Crypto hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Secure enclaves (Apple T2, Yubikey)
- Privacy-first architecture and BYOB (Bring Your Own Backup) models

## üìÑ Contents
- `whitepaper.pdf` ‚Äì full technical proposal
- `pitch-brief.pdf` ‚Äì 1-page summary
- `LICENSE` ‚Äì usage terms

## ‚úÖ Key Concepts
- External memory device with segment-based structure: BIO / HISTORY / TASKS / MARKED
- E2E encryption; user-only key management
- Emergency wipe options
- Optional hybrid sync with cloud
- No access by OpenAI to user memory
- Timestamped idea publication
