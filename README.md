## ðŸ”¹ Abstract

This repository presents a proposal for a modular, encrypted, external memory solution for ChatGPT and other LLM-based platforms.  
Inspired by secure hardware wallets and privacy-first design principles, this system allows users to:

- Fully own and manage their AI memory
- Store it offline or in private cloud storage
- Retain full control over encryption, access, and deletion

## âœ… Key Concepts

- **External BIO-DISK**: USB device or formatted storage partition for personal memory
- **Segmented Structure**: BIO / HISTORY / TASKS / MARKED memory zones
- **Encryption & Keys**: E2E encryption, user-only access
- **Emergency Wipe**: Local and remote options to erase all data
- **Bring Your Own Backup (BYOB)**: OpenAI holds no recovery responsibility

## ðŸ”— Example Commands (Future API Interface)

```python
memory.get(segment="BIO")
memory.query("show me saved tasks")
